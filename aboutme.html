    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <section class="me">
        <img src="icon.png" alt="">
        <p>I'm a second-year engineering student with a strong passion for technology and web development. Currently,
            I'm expanding my skill set by learning HTML and CSS, diving into the world of web design and development. As
            I build my foundation in these essential web technologies, I am developing a keen eye for creating clean,
            responsive, and visually appealing websites. My engineering background gives me a problem-solving mindset,
            which I apply to coding and design challenges. I enjoy experimenting with different layouts and styles,
            always aiming to improve my understanding of front-end development. Outside of my coursework, I'm constantly
            exploring new tools and resources to stay updated with industry trends. I'm excited about the intersection
            of engineering and design, and Iâ€™m eager to apply my knowledge to create innovative and functional web
            applications in the future.</p>
