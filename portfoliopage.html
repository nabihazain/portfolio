            <h2>Amazon Clone Project</h2>
            <p>This Amazon clone project is a simple e-commerce website built using HTML and CSS, designed to replicate
                the basic layout and functionality of Amazon's homepage. It features a clean, responsive design with
                sections like the navigation bar, product categories, featured products, and footer. The project
                showcases the use of HTML for structuring the content and CSS for styling and layout, ensuring a
                user-friendly and visually appealing interface. While it does not include back-end functionalities like
                shopping carts or payment processing, it serves as a front-end prototype for an online store.</p>

            <h2>Weather App Project</h2>
            <p>This weather app project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, integrated with the OpenWeather API to
                fetch real-time weather data. The app allows users to input a city name and retrieve current weather
                details, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions. The interface is styled
                with CSS to provide a clean and responsive design, ensuring a smooth user experience across devices.
                JavaScript is used to handle user input, fetch data from the API, and dynamically display the weather
                information. This project demonstrates how to work with external APIs and provides an interactive way
                for users to check the weather in different locations.</p>
